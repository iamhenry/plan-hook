# Claude Code Plan Hook System

A sophisticated hook system that automatically generates and maintains implementation plans during Claude Code sessions.

## HOW IT WORKS

This system monitors Claude Code's tool usage and automatically creates structured `plan.md` files that track project implementation progress in real-time.

### Core Components

- **plan-hook.sh** - Captures plan content when Claude presents implementation plans
- **file-modification-hook.sh** - Detects when implementation begins (file modifications)
- **todowrite-hook.sh** - Monitors task creation and generates/updates comprehensive plans

### Automatic Plan Generation

When Claude creates TodoWrite tasks during a session, the system:

1. **DETECTS** - TodoWrite tool usage indicating active implementation
2. **GENERATES** - Structured plan.md with task breakdowns and sub-tasks
3. **UPDATES** - Real-time progress tracking with visual status indicators
4. **ENHANCES** - Uses Claude CLI to create junior-developer-friendly guidance

### Plan Structure

Generated plans include:
- Task overview with priority levels
- Detailed implementation steps and sub-tasks
- File modification tracking
- Testing strategies and acceptance criteria
- Progress indicators: ‚è≥ PENDING ‚Üí üöß IN PROGRESS ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Smart Updates

- **Incremental**: Updates task status and checkboxes when only progress changes
- **Full Regeneration**: Creates new comprehensive plans for complex task sets
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Maintains consistency between TodoWrite and plan.md

## Installation

1. Place hook scripts in your project directory
2. Configure Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
3. Ensure proper permissions in `.claude/settings.local.json`

## Integration

Works seamlessly with Claude Code's existing workflow:
- No manual intervention required
- Automatic activation during planning sessions
- Maintains conversation context and history
- Compatible with all Claude Code file operations

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- ‚úÖ Automatically generates plan.md from TodoWrite activity
- ‚úÖ Real-time task status synchronization
- ‚úÖ Junior-developer-friendly implementation guidance
- ‚úÖ Zero-disruption integration with Claude Code workflow
