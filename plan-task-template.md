### Planning and Task Management

### Plan Documentation Protocol
When implementing complex features or multi-step tasks:
1. ALWAYS create a `plan.md` file in the project root
2. Structure tasks with sufficient detail for junior developers
3. Use recursive completion tracking as work progresses
4. Integrate with TodoWrite tool for active session management

#### Task Detail Requirements
Each task MUST include:
- Clear objective a junior developer can understand
- Step-by-step implementation guidance
- Expected file modifications
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Testing strategy and acceptance criteria
- Time estimation where applicable

#### Progress Tracking Protocol
- Update task status immediately upon completion: ‚è≥ ‚Üí üöß ‚Üí ‚úÖ
- Mark sub-tasks with checkboxes for granular progress
- Add completion timestamps and notes
- Link to related TodoWrite entries for active session tracking
- Archive completed plan.md files to `/_ai/completed-plans/` directory

#### Integration with TodoWrite
- Create TodoWrite entries referencing specific plan.md tasks
- Use consistent task naming: "Plan.md: [Task Title]"
- Mark TodoWrite items complete when plan.md tasks are finished
- Maintain bidirectional traceability between tools

#### Plan.md Structure Template
```markdown
